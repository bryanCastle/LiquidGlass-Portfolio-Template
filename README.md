## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **LIQUID GLASS NAVIGATION BUTTONS** are WebGL dependent and tend to have issues loading images inside of glass panels
- To bypass that, I simply added gradients that can give a similar effect
- You just have to replace the image and gradient to your needs
- **SF Pro Fonts**: This template uses Apple's SF Pro font suite - you'll need to either replace with your own fonts or search for them online (they're free from Apple)
- **Customization Required**: Replace placeholder content with your information
